# Computer Science - University of Tennessee
Here are some of the works that I completed as a first year student in Computer Science. As a first year student, I primarily learned the basics of C++, different types of algorithims (such as searching, recursive, and randomized), computer organization, and data structures. Below is a description of each project and lab that i completed during the year.

## Penname
The Penname project was the first lab that was ever assigned in my Computer Science 102 class. The Penname program takes your current information such as your first name, middle name, age, street address, and birth city. The program then takes your information and generates penname information for you to use. 

## Take-Home Pay
The Take-Home Pay program takes a user's inputted annual salary and calculates their take-home salary (post-tax) and their monthly take-home pay.

## Speeding Ticket Calculator
The Speeding Ticket Calculator program takes an input ticket file, produced by a police database, and creates a formatted output file that prints the date, ticket number, and the calculated ticket fee total. 

## PPM Manipulation
The PPM Manipulation program takes an inputted PPM file (from file input and standard input) and prints out a new image to an output files through a set of commands. The set of commands that a user can select from are: invert, flip over the x-axis, and flip over the y-axis.

## Boiling Water
The Boiling Water program prompts the user to select a city from a predetermined list and calculates the boiling point of the city using the city's altitude. 

## BITSET 
The BITSET program uses bitset operators to solve various designed problems. The program can test bits (see if the bits are 1 or 0), set bits, and clear bits.

## Gold
The Gold program takes an inputted map (through file and standard input) and searchs the map for pieces of gold (hidden letters).

## Sorting Algorithims
This program was completed during class and showcases the coding of different sorting algorithims in C++. The sorting algorithims coded are: bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.

## Pascal 
The Pascal program takes an inputted number of rows from the user and generates Pascal's triangle. This program was completed during class.
